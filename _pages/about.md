Hello! I am a first-year PhD student with the [Chemical Engineering](https://cheme.mit.edu) department and the [Center for Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.mit.edu) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I seek to combine informatics, machine learning, and automation to accelerate chemistry and materials research. Ultimately, I aim to address challenges in energy, sustainability, and climate change. I am supported by a [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://nsfgrfp.org).

Before MIT, I double majored in computer science and chemistry at Duke University. There, I did computational research across the disciplines of chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science.

Outside of science and tech, I am interested in photography, calligraphy, and the ocassional hike.
