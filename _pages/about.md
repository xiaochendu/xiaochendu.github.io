Hello, I'm a fourth-year PhD student at MIT, affiliated with the [Chemical Engineering](https://cheme.mit.edu) department and the [Center for Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.mit.edu). Under the guidance of my advisors, [Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli](http://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu) and [Martin Bazant](https://bazantgroup.mit.edu), I'm using deep learning and generative models to advance materials simulations. I am grateful to be a recipient of the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://nsfgrfp.org).

My research focus is on surface reconstruction, with an aim to improve catalysis, energy storage, and other sustainability applications. I am also interested in broader methodogical developments in machine learning for the chemical sciences, such as enhanced sampling, uncertainty quantification, and lifelong learning. Sharing well-documented, reproducible code with the community is a priority for me, and I seek out opportunities to collaborate with researchers from diverse backgrounds. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about research, collaboration, or anything else!

Before MIT, I studied both computer science and chemistry at Duke University and delved into interdisciplinary computational research.

Away from the lab and books, I enjoy photography, playing badminton, and the occasional hike—it's these interests that help me keep my work-life balance amidst my academic pursuits.
