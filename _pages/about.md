Hello, I'm a third-year PhD student at MIT, affiliated with the [Chemical Engineering](https://cheme.mit.edu) department and the [Center for Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.mit.edu). Under the guidance of my advisors, [Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli](http://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu) and [Martin Bazant](https://bazantgroup.mit.edu), I'm combining machine learning with computational techniques to advance materials modelling.

My main focus is on surface reconstruction of metal oxides, with an aim to improve catalysis and electrochemistry. Ultimately, I want my work to contribute to solutions in energy, sustainability, and climate change. I'm grateful for the support of my [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://nsfgrfp.org) in this endeavor.

Before MIT, I studied both computer science and chemistry at Duke University and delved into interdisciplinary computational research.

Away from the lab and books, I enjoy photography, playing badminton, and the occasional hike—it's these interests that keep me balanced amidst my rigorous academic pursuits.
