collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-03-30-bisect
excerpt: 'Tomographic reconstructions of cryopreserved specimens enable in-situ structural studies. Here, the authors present the beam image-shift electron cryo-tomography (BISECT) approach that accelerates data collection speed and improves the map resolution compared to earlier approaches and present the in vitro structure of a 300 kDa protein complex that was solved at 3.6 Å resolution as a test case.'
